# 🚗 Uber Supply-Demand Gap Analysis

This project analyzes ride request data from Uber to identify and explain the **supply-demand imbalance** experienced in July 2016. Using **Excel**, **SQL**, and **Python**, the analysis explores when and where trip failures occur, and proposes data-driven solutions to improve Uber's service performance.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies

- **Excel**: Pivot tables, charts, and dashboards
- **SQL (SQLite)**: Querying structured data and extracting patterns
- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)**: EDA & visualization
- **Google Colab**: Code environment for Python analysis
- **GitHub**: Version control and portfolio hosting

## 📈 Key Insights

- The **Airport** zone had the highest number of trip failures due to "No Cars Available".
- Demand peaked during **7–10 AM** and **5–9 PM**, yet driver supply was insufficient during these windows.
- The **City** had better trip completion rates compared to the Airport.
- Cancellations were highest in the **Morning**, while unavailability was highest in the **Evening**.

---

## ✅ Business Recommendations

- **Incentivize drivers** during peak hours and in underserved zones like the Airport.
- Use **real-time demand prediction** to redistribute drivers dynamically.
- Improve cancellation control with driver/rider reminders and pre-confirmation.
